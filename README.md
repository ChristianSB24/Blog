## Blog Project

In this project I created a basic CRUD Django REST API and hosted it onto Heroku (https://immense-shelf-24544.herokuapp.com/). Additionally, I created a React frontend that is hosted onto Netlify and is able to communicate with the Django REST API (https://hopeful-goldwasser-03adfa.netlify.app/). 

In this project I learned how to impliment different security features onto a Django API. Additionally, I learned how to create a React frontend that displays information from the API while hosting the frontend onto Netlify and the backend onto Heroku.
